FLAGS_HELP="USAGE: build_image [flags] [list of images to build].
This script is used to build a CoreOS image. CoreOS comes in many
different forms.  This scripts can be used to build the following:

base - Pristine CoreOS image for generating update payloads or a dev/prod image.
prod - Production image for CoreOS. This image is for booting.
dev - Developer image. Like base but with additional developer packages.
test - Like dev, but with additional test specific packages and can be easily
  used for automated testing using scripts like run_remote_tests, etc.

Examples:

build_image --board=<board> dev test - builds developer and test images.
