FLAGS_HELP="USAGE: build_image [flags] [list of images to build].
This script is used to build a Chromium OS image. Chromium OS comes in many
different forms.  This scripts can be used to build the following:

base - Pristine Chromium OS image. As similar to Chrome OS as possible.
dev - Developer image. Like base but with additional developer packages.
test - Like dev, but with additional test specific packages and can be easily
  used for automated testing using scripts like run_remote_tests, etc.
factory_test - Like test but with extra packages and modifications used to
  test images in a factory setting.  Cannot be built along with a test image.
factory_install - Install shim for bootstrapping the factory test process.
  Cannot be built along with any other image.

Examples:

build_image --board=<board> dev test - builds developer and test images.
build_image --board=<board> factory_install - builds a factory install shim.
